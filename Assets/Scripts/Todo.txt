TODO
- NEW LEVELS
- portal graphics (light shining thru types)
- diff graphics for altmap and regmap (background, bricks, soundÂ¿)
- ADD AOUND
- restart level option
- wait for a sec before level reload
- portal reset on death
- fix portal angle mechanics
- stretch tiles so they fit width of screen exactly
- powerups??
- particle effects
- end screens

Level Specific
- L9: maybe make it more difficult to get to the portals??
      say, a couple bricks blocking the entrance / having 
      to bounce around angles to get there??

Bugs:
- ball goes straight along wall edge when reflecting at a steep angle
- infinite portal rebounding
- edges don't line up w screen
- uneven collision w brick edges (use tilemap collider?)
? ball moves at a v steep angle => hella boring
