TODO
- diff graphics for altmap and regmap (background, bricks, trail gradient?)
- diff portal graphics
- ADD AOUND
- fix portal angle mechanics ??
- particle effects (more!!)

Level Specific
- L8: maybe make it more difficult to get to the portals??
      say, a couple bricks blocking the entrance / having 
      to bounce around angles to get there??

Bugs:
- ball goes straight along wall edge when reflecting at a steep angle
- infinite portal rebounding
- uneven collision w brick edges (use tilemap collider?)
- trail follows ball when life lost
? ball moves at a v steep angle => hella boring
