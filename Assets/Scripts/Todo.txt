TODO
- NEW LEVELS
- portal graphics (light shining thru types)
- diff graphics for altmap and regmap (background, bricks, soundÂ¿)
- ADD AOUND
- restart level option
- portal reset on death
- fix portal angle mechanics
- stretch tiles so they fit width of screen exactly
- powerups??
- particle effects
- end screens

Bugs:
- ball goes straight along wall edge when reflecting at a steep angle
- infinite portal rebounding
- edges don't line up w screen
- uneven collision w brick edges (use tilemap collider?)
? ball moves at a v steep angle => hella boring
