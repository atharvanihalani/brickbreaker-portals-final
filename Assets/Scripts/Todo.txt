TODO
- Sounds: background music
- particle effects (more!!)
- fix portal angle mechanics ??

Level Specific
- L8: maybe make it more difficult to get to the portals??
      say, a couple bricks blocking the entrance / having 
      to bounce around angles to get there??

Bugs:
- uneven collision w brick edges (use tilemap collider?)
- trail follows ball when life lost
